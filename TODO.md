TODO list
=========================

Here is a list of things that still should be done...

*   Port to GTK+3.0
    Long time without coding; GTK+ improved (and deprecated) so much...
*   A CLI client
    Maybe with [Lua](http://www.lua.org) scripting support?
*   Smart search
*   Search & Replace
*   Better text edition
*   Better code documentation
